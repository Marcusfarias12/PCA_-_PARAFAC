# PCA_-_PARAFAC
PCA for UV-VIS Spectroscopy, PARAFAC for spectrofluorimetry

For PCA, you'll need archives in either .csv or .xlsx. I've inserted some lines of code if someone wants to covert them. 
For PARAFAC, you'll need .xlsx files containing all the data. Pyhton will stack them in 3-D and perform PARAFAC (although it's usually slower than PCA)
