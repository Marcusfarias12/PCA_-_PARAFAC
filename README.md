# PCA&PARAFAC
                                                          PCA for UV-VIS Spectroscopy, PARAFAC for spectrofluorimetry

Those files were created for performing PCA & PARAFAC on Spectroscopy datasets. They worked for the specific project I was working on, but with subtle changes it may work with other types of datasets.

(Archive "New" is used just to covert .csv to .xlsx for PCA)

For PCA, you'll need archives in either .csv or .xlsx. I've inserted some lines of code if someone wants to covert them. 
For PARAFAC, you'll need .xlsx files containing all the data. Pyhton will stack them in 3-D and perform PARAFAC (although it's usually slower than PCA).
